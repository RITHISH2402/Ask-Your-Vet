First and foremost, has your dog been vaccinated against rabies?\n\n*   **If yes:** Even with vaccination, exposure to rabies requires immediate attention. We need to schedule an appointment for a booster vaccination and a period of observation. Please keep your dog isolated and prevent any contact with other animals or people.\n\n*   **If no:** This is a critical situation. Rabies is almost always fatal without intervention. We need to isolate your dog immediately to protect others. The options we can discuss are quarantine and observation, or, unfortunately, due to public health concerns and animal welfare, euthanasia may be recommended. I understand this is incredibly difficult, but my priority is preventing the spread of this deadly disease and minimizing suffering.\n\nIn either case, please tell me:\n\n*   **How was your dog potentially exposed to rabies?** (e.g., bite from a wild animal like a raccoon or bat, contact with saliva, etc.)\n*   **What symptoms is your dog showing?** (e.g., changes in behavior, aggression, paralysis, drooling, difficulty swallowing, etc.)\n\nPlease answer these questions so I can advise you properly.

This is crucial to prevent the spread of the virus.\n2.  **Wash any wounds thoroughly:** If you or anyone else has been bitten, scratched, or exposed to your dog's saliva (especially on broken skin or mucous membranes), wash the area vigorously with soap and water for at least 10-15 minutes.\n3.  **Contact Public Health Authorities and/or Animal Control *immediately*:** They are the primary responders in suspected rabies cases.
